This challenge is part of a tutorial track by MyCodeSchool and is accompanied by a video lesson.

Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, change the next pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

Example
references the list

Manipulate the pointers of each node in place and return , now referencing the head of the list .

reverse has the following parameter:

SinglyLinkedListNode pointer head: a reference to the head of a list
Returns

SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the reversed list
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of test cases.

Each test case has the following format:

The first line contains an integer , the number of elements in the linked list.
Each of the next lines contains an integer, the values of the elements in the linked list.

Constraints
